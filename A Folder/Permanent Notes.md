# Permanent Notes
- They are the core of the [[Zettelkasten Method]].
- This are notes made from the [[Literature Notes]] in which each individual topic, idea or concept is extracted and put into separate notes.

### Permanent Notes have several *criteria* to meet:
- Only **one idea per note** but as complete as possible.
- Write it as if you were explaining it to somebody else
- Show the content source
- Precise, clear and brief
- The content of the note should be able to be understood even outside of the context

### Questions to ask yourself when writing Permanent Notes:
-	How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-	Does this add, contradict or explain an Idea of what I already know?
-	What does this mean for some other idea I already have.
