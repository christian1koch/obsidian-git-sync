- A Unit will be tested as isolated as possible. Without it having to work with others.
- In the Unit Test all methods and constructors should be tested at least once. 
- Focus on difficult methods and not in the simple set/get methods.
- You don't need a Test for every method.
- You need to test al consequences of the code that is being tested.
- Don't copy past calculations from the test, instead try to get to the result yourself or find another process that should arrive to the same result.
- Call the methods that will be tested multiple times with
	- Normal Values
	- Limit/boundary/grenz Values
	- Edge Cases (null, 29.2.2020)
	- False Values
- Exhaust all the Gamma of Datatype of the parameters, leave your comfort zone.
- Check how the differnt methods work together in different cases:
	- In situations that would normally be used.
	- In situations that only will appear in edge cases.
	- In situations that in the Praxis won't appear, but are possible to recreate.
- Check for: 
	- Return type
	- All the atributes of the object that can change.
	- The attributes that the Parameters change.
	- Side Effects.
	- Is the programm doing something that it shouldn't do?
		- Attributes from this or attributrs from Parameters?
		- Changing external ressources?
