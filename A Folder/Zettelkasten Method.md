# The Zettelkasten Method

Is a 3-Step Notetaking process that allows a very useful knowledge managment system and a memorization enhancement by working similar how the brain works, by making connections.

This goes against the typical Folder Method where notes are categorized in folder to be easier to find. The reason being is that folder separation doesn't help making connections, indeed the opposite, you don't make any connection to different notes outside the folder and sometimes even inside the folder. That's why the Zettelkasten Method avoids this alltogether and focuses only on Permanent notes that are linked together based on how they relate, this mimics the brain way of storing information through connections.

There are 3 steps in this notetaking system:
[[Fleeting Notes]] -> [[Literature Notes]] -> [[Permanent Notes]]
