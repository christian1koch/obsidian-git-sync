- Watched the Video from Ali regarding [[Deep Work]].
- There were 5 key points regarding deep work.

## 1. Shallow work and Deep work

Shallow work means doing little things that are in your todo list that you have to do, for example:
- E-mails
- Answering important messages
- Calling a coworker

[[Deep Work]] is about doing the work that drive us towards our goals.
- In my case would be studying for the university classes I have this semester.
- And working through my emotions and problems in order to solve them.
- In work it would mean to do the stories I have to work on.

## 2. Treat Focus as a Muscle

I should not thing as focus as something I don't have or complicated, but as a muscle I can train and improve. Ali gives 2 tips to improve focus. 
- One is to set up aside a time for focusing, he talks a lot about 4-hour-work, which is what he says he does in a daily basis. 
	- He also talks about that constraining something to a time frame makes it you finish it faster, an example is when you say you will do that in 30 minutes at a given time, it forces you to want to finish it at that given time, in contrast to when you say you'll do it throughout the day, you'll probably procrastinaty on it until the end of the day.
- The other tip is to remove distractions, Ali sets his phone away and turns off his slack notifications when he is doing deep work. I really don't get how this is training, but probably I have to look more into how to train focus.

## 3. Chase the goals that are more meaningful

Deep work is all about the goals that mean to me and that moves me towards what I want to achieve in life. As I said my most meaningful goal is finishing university, and for that I need to finish the courses I am doing.

It is also impotant that deep work has to be ONLY for the goals you find more meaningful, if not is not deep work.

## 4. Make it a habit

Make a routine to work on your Deep Work, preferably a time you would do deep work each day.  Think about what time of the day you are most focus and work on that time. Shoot for a 4-hour-deep work max, since that is what in the book is the cap of deep work.

## 5. Embrace the feeling of deep work

When you finish your deep work, you will feel more accomplished and that you worked more towards your goals. You can notice it at the end of the day when you feel satisfied of doing some deep work.

## How to get better at Deep Work

### Define it.
- Differenciate between deep work and shallow work when you are working. Think actively, this is deep work, this is shallow work.

### Measue it.
- Find ideal ratio of deep work/shallow work. Shallow work is important, in the sense of studying it could mean, sending e-mails to profressor, organizing something, etc. You might need to find a good ratio, for example 50/50, in which half of the time is deep work and the other half of the time is shallow work.

### Schedule it.
- You need to schedule deep work and commit to it as if it were an important meeting. Treating it as a ritual helps, for example: At this day, at this hour I will go there do my coffe and work on this.

## Train it.
- It won't be easy from the get go, because you have lost all your ability to focus. But this is like a muscle, so train it by not giving up, and doing exercises.
