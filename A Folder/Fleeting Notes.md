# Fleeting Notes

- These notes as the name implies are taken on the fly, while you are consuming the content
- They are the first step in the [[Zettelkasten Method]]
- They are only for remembering in order to help do the more expanded version of them which are the [[Literature Notes]]
- They won't be stored like [[Permanent Notes]]
