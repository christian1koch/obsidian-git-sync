### What is the ONE THING that you can do so that everything else becomes easy or unnecessary?

- The idea is to setup our todolist like domino's so that finish one task sets up to start the other.
- Starting is the hardest part, and when you break things down into their smaller parts it makes tasks that much easier.
- To go break things down into smaller chunks you need to start big and ask the question in the title.

**Example:**
- What is the one thing I want to do this year?
	- What is the one thing I want to do this month?
		- What is the one thing I want to do this week?
			- What is the one thing I want to do this day?

- If we know what our future goals will be this will help us know what our current goals will also be.
- Different Domains in Life have different one one things. (Health, Studies, Work, Family, Friends, Integrit)

**Example 2**
- What is the one thing I can do to **have better sleep** so that everything else becomes easy or unnecesary? A:**Getting tired throught the day**
- What is the one thing I can do to get **tired throught the day**, so that everything else becomes easy or unnecesary?: A: **Do sports for an Hour**
-  What is the one thing I can do to **do sports for an hour**, so that everything else becomes easy or unnecesary? A:  **Play a sport I enjoy**
- What is the one thing I can do to **play a sport I enjoy**, so that everything else becomes easy or unnecesary? A: **Call a sport verein**
