# Processing: Flow

- setup() and draw()
- We can think that nothing else happens in the programming flow in processing, outside setup() and draw()


### setup()
- Will happen once.
- Very often size() will appear here in order to set the window size
```java
// the following is the implementation of setup

void setup() {
	// something for the start
}
```


### draw()
- Will happen over and over again in a loop.
```java
// the following is the implementation of draw()

void draw() {
	//something that happens in the draw function
}
