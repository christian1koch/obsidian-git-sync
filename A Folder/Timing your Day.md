### Time blindness:
#### What is it?
- The inability to know what time is it, how much time is left and how quickly time is passing.
- Unterestimating how long something is going to take.
- Time predictions end up being completely unrealistic.

#### How to do more accurate time predictions?
- To every task there are 3 parts, **setup**, **doing** and **cleanup**.
- People mostly think about the doing but forget the other 3 times which need to be timed as well.
- **Use a Timer** and avoid using the phone's timer.
- Time your daily tasks in order to know how much they last.
- Use your Timing sheet: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11J9aDarGms4326iAMKXGGi-sOu_btemY3Culf9oX6tM/edit

After knowing what your daily activities (and your activities in general last) you can [[Make time for the important stuff]]
