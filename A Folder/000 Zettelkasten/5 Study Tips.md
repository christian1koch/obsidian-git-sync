Threshold Concepts
	- Topics we don't understand but afterwards we have a lightbulb moment.

- Tip 1: Primming
	- Also called pre-learning
	- before learning anything try to have a general overview of the topic
		- This can be done through skimming over the titles of a text for exmaple
- Tip 2: Engaging with the topic
	- Requires energy
	- As soon as a new idea or topic arises, try to think of any possible question
		- Ask how and why questions!
- Tip 3: When to review
	- In the first 12 hours.
	- Mainly in the same day that the topic was first consumed
	- If possible before going to bed in order to trigger sleep memorization or something like that which is like studying while sleeping.
- Tip 4:
	- Revise or consolidate information
		- Good with mindmaps
		- Use multiple sences and not only words to express ideas
			- Words and sentences last resource.
	- Confusion is good and you dont need to perma take notes
	- Simplified notes in your head
		- Trains our brain to do learning without having to perma write.
- Tip 5: Pre-exam revision guidelines.
	- Always challenging, don't do it in things we know.
