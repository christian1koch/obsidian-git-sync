# How to make time for the important stuff?

## What is a Priority?
- Concern or desire that comes before all others
- We dont always know why a priority is a priority.
- Not everything can be a priority
- We very often run our life due date to due date.
- In order to know for you what is a prority, you need to know what is important to you. Journaling is a good way to start knowing what is important to you.
	- Ask yourself question about what and why things are important to you.
	- Dont settle with the first answer and keep asking why.
	- After that you can draw keywords for example, **Learning**, **Challenge**, **Family**.
	- Imagine yourself in your memorial, what would you like people saying about you.
- Using those value you can define what is the most important thing in your ToDo list,.
	- If things in your ToDo list aren't inline with your values is time to check either your values or what you are doing.
- Prioritizing because of your values makes you stop doing things because you have to and do things because you want to.

 But just knowing this won't help to make everything fall into tidy order, BUT it is the first step.

 ## Eisenhauer decision principle:

![[Eisenhauer Chart Todoist 1.png]]
 - Urgent is not the same as Important
- Urgent means to time, the more Urgent the fastest it has to be accomplished and Important means the value and impact of the task.
- We dont want to only live in the urgent side priority matrix.
- #focus 

## Time Horizons and Proyects
- Is hard for people with Time Blindness: [[Timing your Day]]
- With adhd we have very short time horizons, sometimes max 2 weeks.
- Feels don't feel urgent when they are outside 
- With time blindness is very hard to make things that aren't urgent a priority.
- **With projects outside our time horizions is important to break them into smaller chunks to see which of them are urgent and which aren't**
	- Look for **Bottlenecks**, things that slow down or stops progress of everything else or...
		- If they knock down down any other dominos in the todolist or made them easier to knock down: [[Breaking down the one thing]]
- In projects **BOTTLENECKS ARE YOUR PRIORITIES**
