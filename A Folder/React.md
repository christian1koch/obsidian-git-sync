### Why React?
- It's composable:
	- Similar to lego bricks, multiple components make a whole application.
- It's declarative:
	- Opposite to Imperative
	- Declarative: What should be done?
		- Tell me what to do, and I'll worry about how to get it done
	- Imperative: How it should be done?
		- Describe to me every step on how to do something, and I'll do it.
- Uses [[JSX]], which is a Javascript extension that let us create components with a very similar syntax to html.
