# Functional Requirements

- Product freature or functions that the developer must provide for the [[Software]] that is being developed.
- These requirements can range from high level abstract statements to detailed mathematical specific ones.
- Example:
	- The Software should allow changing the language to german by clicking on one button.
	- Only Managers can change the background color of the software.
- Functional Requirements focus mainly on the product feature, in contrast to [[Non Functional Requirements]] which focus on product attributes.
